# Forensic Challenges

## 1. Disk Recovery (PicoCTF: Snapcat - 80)
It was found that a Daedalus employee was storing his personal files on a work computer. Unfortunately, he corrupted the filesystem before we could prove it. 

Can you take a look and find the flag

## 2. Android Reversing (PicoCTF: Droid App - 80)
An Android application was released for the toaster bots, but it seems like this one is some sort of debug version. 

Can you discover the presence of any flag information being stored

## Notes
Both 1 and 2 are taken from the PicoCTF website, I really recommend you check it out if you haven't already. There are plenty of challenges on there with a very friendly learning curve.
