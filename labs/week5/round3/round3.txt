Round 3:

Try some simple brute forcing with hashcat.

you may need to update hashcat:

	'apt-get update'
	'apt-get install hashcat'

For the first file try the following command:

	'hashcat -m 0 -a 3 hash1 ?a?a?a?a'

This should be nice and quick.
Now try hash2 and hash3. The passwords for them are 5 and 6 characters long respectively. You can modify the command line to suit.

** After each one has started press 's' to show the status, including estimated time to complete. p to you if yo want to wait for hash3 to finish!
