Round 4:

try breaking these with John ..... it will be (mostly) very easy.


Start with:

	'john pass1'

pass1 and pass2 are simple words which are included in john's default word list.

The password for pass3 is a name, but no meta data was entered for the user.
This will take a while, so cancel it when you get bored.

The password for pass4 is the same but the name has been entered in the user's meta data.
John's defauult mode will use the meta data for a user as part of its word list.

The password for pass5 is based on the user details, but John automatically tries certain simple mangling.
