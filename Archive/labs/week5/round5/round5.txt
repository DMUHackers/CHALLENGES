Round 5:

The importance of word lists.

Try running john on pass1....


It is a simple alphabetic password, even so, the number of possibilities is very large and this will take a while.
When you get bored, cancel then try the following:

	'john pass1 -w=/usr/share/wordlists/fasttrack.txt'

This should be a lot quicker!
Now try the same thing with pass2...
