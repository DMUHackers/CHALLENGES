#Dmu Hackers - Week 8
To fill in any left over time we are revisiting Bandit and Natas to over the wire but this time we are giving you write-ups explain how other people have completed the challenges. If you get stuck we recommend you take note of what they have done this will not just help you for over the wire but it will also help you for future challenges as well. You can find the writeup links to help you with the challenges below.
